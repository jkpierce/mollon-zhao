This is a rough implementation of the Mollon Zhao algorithm to make 
particles of arbitrary shape from their fourier shape descriptors.

This could be potentially interesting for analyzing the downstream erosion 
of particles as they travel down river systems, since fourier shape
descriptors contain more information than most other options

Also these randomly generated polyhedra with prescribed statitsical 
shape descriptors could be very interesting to analyze the variation of 
particle packing or transport properties in a DEM model adapted to handle
particles of arbitrary shape, such as the Grains3D algorithm utilizing GJK 
contact evaluations as developed by Anthony Wachs at UBC
